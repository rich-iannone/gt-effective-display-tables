# The gt datasets {#sec-appendix-datasets}

Every dataset tells a story. The eighteen datasets bundled with **gt** were not assembled arbitrarily or pulled from dusty archives of convenient CSV files. Each one emerged from a specific need, a personal curiosity, or a gap in what was publicly available. Some model human behavior with surprising fidelity. Others preserve scientific data that would otherwise remain scattered across obscure government pages. A few exist simply because I thought "I wish this dataset existed" and then made it so.

This appendix takes you behind the scenes of these datasets. You will learn where they came from, how they were constructed, and why they matter beyond their immediate utility as demonstration data. Along the way, we will explore the broader contexts they represent: the economics of a neighborhood pizza shop, the 125-year evolution of urban transit in Paris, the delicate chemistry of Earth's atmosphere, and the quiet dramas of population change in Ontario's small towns. The datasets are more than rows and columns. They are windows into worlds worth understanding.
